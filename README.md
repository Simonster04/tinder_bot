# Tinder Bot:

The idea of this project is to automate likes (Tinder working for its own).

## Recomendations:
Create a virtual enviroment fo executing the code.

## Usage:
- Download chromedriver, unzip, move to /usr/local/bin (Mac OS / Linux)

- Install `selenium` package:
```python
pip install selenium


- Update `credentials.py` with the username and password you use in Tinder.

- Execute the code in interactive mode:
```python
python3 -i tinder_bot.py

After checking the bot's logging in was OK, execute `auto_like()` or `auto_super()` in the interactive window as below:
```python
bot.auto_like()
